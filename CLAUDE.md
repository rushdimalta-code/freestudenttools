# CLAUDE.md — Free Student Tools

_Last updated: 2026-06-16 (rev 3)_

---

## Project Purpose

Public static web app offering free browser-based tools for students. All processing is client-side — files never leave the user's device. No accounts, no sign-up, no paywalls.

Monetisation: Google AdSense (pub ID: `ca-pub-9843476971668607`). Account created; **not yet approved** — reapply after verifying contact form and content depth.

## Current State

## Stack

- Static HTML/CSS/JS — one HTML file per tool, no build step
- Hosted on Netlify (free tier) — `netlify.toml` configures caching headers + redirects
- `css/style.css` — single shared stylesheet, CSS variables via `:root`
- `js/common.js` — shared: GA4, AdSense deferred load, dropdown nav, cookie consent, back-to-top, scroll animations, utilities
- `js/config.js` — `window.FST_CONFIG` with `GOOGLE_MAPS_KEY` (currently empty — needs Maps Embed API enabled in Google Cloud Console)
- `data/` — JS data files exposed as `window.*` globals (see Data Files section below)
- No backend, no auth, no user accounts

## Data Files

| File | Global | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `data/universities.js` | `window.UNI_DATA` | 40 Tier-1 universities — full admissions, accommodation, deadline, streams |
| `data/universities_all.js` | `window.UNI_ALL` | 1,000 ranked universities — name, country, ranking, streams. **Auto-generated — never edit manually** |
| `data/uni_guide.js` | `window.UNI_GUIDE` | 42 entries + 5 aliases — city, CoL, rental links, contacts, leisure |
| `data/courses.js` | `window.COURSES_DATA` | 16 academic streams — curriculum, assessment, careers, uni-specific programme info |
| `data/scholarships_data.js` | `window.SCHOLARSHIP_DATA` | 246 scholarships — last updated 2026-06-16 |

To regenerate `universities_all.js`: `python3 tools/fetch_all_universities.py`

## Analytics & Ads

**GA4:** `G-WX0M0TK16J` — set in `js/common.js`. Fires only after cookie consent.

**AdSense:** `ca-pub-9843476971668607` — loaded via `initAds()` in `js/common.js` after cookie consent. Ad slot IDs in HTML pages are **placeholders** (`1111111111`, `2222222222`, `3333333333`) — replace with real slot IDs from AdSense dashboard after account approval.

**Cookie consent:** Both GA and AdSense are gated behind the cookie banner. `localStorage.cookie_consent === 'accepted'` triggers both.

---

## SEO & GEO

- Canonical URLs on all pages
- Meta descriptions + OG/Twitter tags on all pages
- Structured data: FAQPage on tool pages; Article + FAQPage on tips.html; Article on scholarship-guide.html; WebSite + Organization + FAQPage on index.html
- `sitemap.xml` — 17 URLs, correct priorities
- `robots.txt` — all major AI crawlers allowed (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Google-Extended)
- `llms.txt` — present, structured for AI citation
- Related tool chips at bottom of each tool page (internal linking)

---

## Navigation

Desktop nav uses **dropdown groups** (managed via JS in `common.js`):
- **University Hub** → Admissions Tracker, Scholarships Finder, Scholarship Guide, Compare Degrees, Student Tips
- **Tools** → OCR Scanner, PDF Converter, PDF Compressor, Image Compressor, PDF Merger, PDF Page Extractor, Citation Generator

Active nav link is set by JS in `common.js` — do **not** hardcode `class="active"` in HTML nav links.

Mobile nav: flat list with section labels (`.nav-mobile-label`), also active class set by JS.

## Visual Design (CDO — 2026-06-16 rev 3)

`index.html` + `css/style.css`:

- **Hero headline:** "Scholarships. Admissions. All Free. All in One Place." (was "Free Document Tools")
- **Hero CTAs:** "Find Scholarships" → `scholarships.html` + "Browse Universities" → `admissions.html` (were OCR/PDF links)
- **Hero:** animated floating color orbs (indigo/green/blue, CSS keyframes), gradient animated headline (blue→violet→cyan), shimmer indigo→violet CTA button
- **Scholarship ticker:** scrolling marquee strip between hero and hub section — 16 real scholarship names with country flags, CSS `translateX` animation, pauses on hover
- **Hub cards:** upgraded with `.hub-card-visual` header area — large emoji icon + country flags row + frosted-glass background panel per card
- **Spotlight strip:** dark bar above hero, shows "Today's Tool" rotating by weekday (pure JS)
- **Tool cards:** gradient top stripe + colored glow shadow on hover
- **Scroll animations:** `[data-animate]` + `[data-delay="1"–"7"]` — IntersectionObserver stagger in `common.js`
- **Counters:** hero stat numbers count up on load via `data-target` attribute
- **Section headings:** gradient blue→violet underline on `.section-h-accent` elements
- **Reduced motion:** all animated effects disabled via `prefers-reduced-motion`

Design tokens: `--primary: #1A73E8` · `--success: #10B981` · `--orange: #F7941D` · purple `#7C3AED`
Font: Inter (400–800) via Google Fonts. Hero bg: dark navy `#0B1120 → #0F2456 → #1A1040`.

**Bot guard (2026-06-16):** `tools/update_university_data.py` — if `scholarships_data.js` has ≥50 scholarships, the daily bot skips list replacement and only refreshes status fields. The 246 scholarships are permanent.

## AdSense — Why It Was Rejected & What's Fixed

**Fixed (2026-06-16):**
- Contact form was broken (`YOUR_FORM_ID` placeholder) → now uses Netlify Forms
- `scholarship-guide.html` was orphaned (zero internal links) → now in nav + linked from scholarships page
- AdSense script was loading before cookie consent → now deferred via `initAds()`

**Still required before reapplying:**
- Confirm Netlify Forms email notifications are configured (Netlify dashboard → Forms)
- Add slot IDs only after account is approved
- Consider adding one more content guide (e.g. OCR or PDF tools guide) to increase editorial depth

## Cross-sell — easedit.co

easedit.co CTAs are live on three high-intent pages, placed between main content and SEO section:
- `admissions.html` — "Got a university interview coming up?"
- `scholarships.html` — "Scholarship shortlisted? Most awards include an interview round."
- `compare.html` — "Narrowed it down to your top picks? The next step is the interview."

Keep these CTAs. Do not remove on future edits.

---

## Key Rules

- Each tool is a separate HTML file — keep them independent
- No paid API calls without confirming with user first
- New tools follow the same pattern — check existing HTML files before building
- Never hardcode `class="active"` on nav links — JS sets it via current URL
- New pages must be added to: nav HTML (all pages), `sitemap.xml`, and `llms.txt`
- Ad slot IDs in HTML are placeholders until AdSense approves the account — do not treat them as real
- `data/universities_all.js` is auto-generated — never edit manually; run `python3 tools/fetch_all_universities.py` to regenerate
- easedit.co CTAs on admissions/scholarships/compare — keep them, don't overwrite
- Scholarship count in `scholarships_data.js` is now 246 — homepage and scholarships.html updated to reflect this
- `scholarship.html` is a new dynamic detail page — routes `/scholarship.html?id=xxx` to per-scholarship profile with JSON-LD, FAQ, and full eligibility details
- Netlify redirect `/scholarship/:id → /scholarship.html?id=:id` gives clean SEO URLs for all 246 scholarships
- Sitemap.xml now includes 246 individual scholarship profile URLs for Google indexing
